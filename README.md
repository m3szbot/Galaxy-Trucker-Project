# Galaxy Trucker Multiplayer Game

## üßæ Project Overview

A **LAN-based multiplayer** implementation of the strategy board game **Galaxy Trucker**, built in **Java** using a **fat server-thin client** architecture and the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern.

This project was developed as part of a **group project** (4 members) between **February 2025 ‚Äì June 2025** for the **Software Engineering course** at **Politecnico di Milano**.

The game supports both **Text-based UI (TUI)** and **Graphical UI (GUI)** using **JavaFX**, along with **TCP/IP socket** and **RMI** protocols for client-server communication.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The game is **unplayable in its uploaded state**, as the image resources are under copyright and have been removed from the repository.  
> TUI gameplay screenshots are available in the **`/screenshots`** folder.
