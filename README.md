# Galaxy Trucker Multiplayer Game

## üßæ Project Overview

A **LAN-based multiplayer** implementation of the strategy board game **Galaxy Trucker**, built in **Java** using a **fat server-thin client** architecture and the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern.

This project was developed as part of a **group project** (4 members) between **February 2025 ‚Äì June 2025** for the **Software Engineering course** at **Politecnico di Milano**.

The game supports both **Text-based UI (TUI)** and **Graphical UI (GUI)** using **JavaFX**, along with **TCP/IP socket** and **RMI** protocols for client-server communication.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The game is **unplayable in its uploaded state**, as the image resources are under copyright and have been removed from the repository.  
> TUI gameplay screenshots are available in the **`/screenshots`** folder.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Instructions to Execute the JAR

Before proceeding, ensure you have a **recent version of OpenJDK** installed.  
**Recommended:** JDK **23.0.\*** or later.

### **Step 1 ‚Äî Download the ZIP File**

- Navigate to the **GitHub main branch**.  
- Go to the directory: `deliverables/final/jar`  
- Download the provided **ZIP** file.

### **Step 2 ‚Äî Unzip the File**

- Locate the downloaded ZIP file in your **Downloads** folder.  
- Extract it to your preferred location.


### **Step 3 ‚Äî Start the Server**

- Open the unzipped folder.  
- Navigate to: `GalaxyTruckerServer/Files`  
- Open a terminal in this directory and run:

```bash
java -jar Server.jar
```
The server should now be **running** and ready to accept client connections.

### **Step 4 ‚Äî Start the Client**

- Open the unzipped folder.  
- Navigate to: `GalaxyTruckerClient/Files`  
- Open a terminal in this directory.

Depending on your operating system, run:

#### **Windows**
```bash
.\run-client-windows.bat

### Step 4) Execute the client

Open the unziped file. Go to the directory 'GalaxyTruckerClient/Files. Open a terminal in the directory. Now, depending on your OS do the following:

Windows: execute the command '.\run-client-windows.bat'.

MacOS: execute the command 'chmod +x run-client-macos.sh' to make sure you have the permission to execute the file. Then execute the command './run-client-macos.sh'.

Linux: execute the command 'chmod +x run-client-linux.sh' to make sure you have the permission to execute the file. Then execute the command './run-client-linux.sh'.

The client should now be running.

You can now start playing.
