# Project Overview

A LAN-based multiplayer strategy board game implementation of Galaxy Trucker, built in Java using a fat server-thin client architecture and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering group project (4 members) between February 2025 â€“ June 2025 at the Politecnico di Milano.

The game supports both Text-based UI (TUI) and Graphical UI (GUI) using JavaFX, along with TCP/IP socket and RMI protocols for client-server communication. The game is unplayable in its uploaded state, as the image resources are under copyright and have been removed from the repo. TUI gameplay screenshots are provided in the screenshots folder.

 # Implemented functionalities

 Complete rule set + TUI + GUI + RMI + Socket + 2 AF

 The 2 AF (advanced functionalities) are:

 1) Test flight
 2) Multiple games

In addition to those AF, we have implmented 2 extra functionalities not indicated in the project specification:

1) The possibility to send a message to a specific player inside a game (private message).
2) The possibility to send a message to all the players inside a game (public message).

# Instructions to execute the jar

Before continuing with the instructions please make sure that you have a recent version of openJDK installed on your system. Versions 23.0.* upwards should be fine.

### Step 1) Download the zip file containing the jar files

Go to the github main branch. Go to the directory 'deliverables/final/jar' and download the zip file.

### Step 2) Unzip the zip file

Go to your system download directory and unzip the zip file that you just downloaded.

### Step 3) Execute the server

Open the unziped file. Go to the directory 'GalaxyTruckerServer/Files'. Open a terminal in the directory and execute the command 'java -jar Server.jar'.
The server should now be running.

### Step 4) Execute the client

Open the unziped file. Go to the directory 'GalaxyTruckerClient/Files. Open a terminal in the directory. Now, depending on your OS do the following:

Windows: execute the command '.\run-client-windows.bat'.

MacOS: execute the command 'chmod +x run-client-macos.sh' to make sure you have the permission to execute the file. Then execute the command './run-client-macos.sh'.

Linux: execute the command 'chmod +x run-client-linux.sh' to make sure you have the permission to execute the file. Then execute the command './run-client-linux.sh'.

The client should now be running.

You can now start playing.
